### How do legislators engage with federal agencies?
--

- Pre-legislation coordination 
--

- Traditional oversight (e.g., hearings, investigations, & reports)
--

- Post-legislation agency policymaking (e.g., rulemaking & budget allocation)  
--

- Casework/constituency service (implementation)
--


### New data & measures 
- Legislator correspondence with agencies (from FOIA requests)
--

- Agency rulemaking records
--

- Agency budget justifications & appropriation subcommittee reports

???

Instead of starting with a definition of congressional oversight behavior and seeking out measures for it, I start with data on contacts between members of Congress and federal agencies and ask what portions might be thought of as different types of oversight. My inductive approach provokes some conceptual issues about what counts as oversight. 

---



###  Traditional oversight (e.g., hearings, investigations, & reports)

Citing those investigations and hearings, Levin here wrote in support of a proposed rule from the Treasury Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network.

Here, in 2012 senator living wrote to the IRS, entering a Committee Report and full 1000-page hearing transcript into the record supporting the rule.

# New data & measures

### Legislator attention to agency rulemaking is uneven over time 

Most agency rules receive no attention from legislators

```{r,fig.cap = "Rulemaking Comments from Members of Congress per Year, 2005-2020", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/data-congress-1.png")

One mechanism by which campaigns may influence policy is by mobilizing members of Congress. Thus, I identify comments submitted by members of Congress and count the number of legislators in each lobbying coalition. Figure \@ref(fig:data-congress) shows the number of comments from members of Congress received during rulemaking by a sample of federal agencies. There is massive variation in the level of attention that members of Congress pay to different agencies and rules. The spikes in attention to each agency correspond with public pressure campaigns targeting rules from that agency. Oversight letters are frequently co-signed by multiple members from the Senate, House, or both chambers. Some of the rules on which members of Congress commented appear in the hand-coded sample. Table \@ref(tab:data-coded-elected) shows the number of comments from the most common types of elected officials in the hand-coded data. Members of the U.S. House and Senate are the most common.

## 90% of U.S. law is now made in agencies rather than Congress. 

Lobbying & pressure campaigns thus target bureaucratic policymaking. 

- Do pressure campaigns affect congressional oversight? 

- Do allies in Congress help pressure campaigns win? 

---

## Do pressure campaigns mobilize oversight? 

Lobbying 

- Legislators write more letters supporting companies when they receive more PAC funding from those companies [(Powell et al., 2022)](https://judgelord.github.io/research/ferc)

Attention (Jones & Baumgartner 2005)

- Mobilized constituencies (e.g., Veterans, Seniors) mobilize legislators [(Snyder et al. 2020)](http://www.womeninlegislativestudies.org/uploads/1/3/5/1/135128342/cr.pdf)

- Legislators follow trending issues (Brookhart & Tahk 2015, Barberá 2019)

- Information affects legislator behavior (Butler and David 2011)

---

## Do allies in Congress help pressure campaigns to win? 

- Agency responses to interest groups depend on Congressional attention (Yackee 2006)

- Legislators respond to pressure. Agencies respond to legislators.

> "Undertakers and used-car dealers were outraged by these proposed rules. Very quickly, members of Congress discovered just how many undertakers and car dealers they had in their districts and how well-connected they were. The FTC suddenly had activated large, hostile interests who were successful in getting Congress to force the agency to back down" (Wilson 1989, 83).

- Yet, lettermarking may be less effective than earmarking (Mills et al. 2015)

---

## Information is the currency of lobbying

### Scholars focus on *technical* information (see Yackee 2019)

- Bureaucratic policymaking, especially, is about expertise (Wagner 2010)

--

### Does *political* information matter?

- Coalition size? (Nelson and Yackee 2012)

- Level of public pressure/attention? (Balla et al. 2020, Judge-Lord 2021)

- Level of attention or support from members of Congress? (Yackee 2006, Wilson 1989, Mills et al. 2015, [Judge-Lord 2017](https://judgelord.github.io/research/budgets/), Lowande & Potter 2021)

???

Everything we know about lobbying, especially lobbying in agency rulemaking, tells us that information is the currency of lobbying. 

Information is how you get policymakers to change their minds, especially experts and lawyers.

Indeed, research shows that business groups dominate lobbying in rulemaking because they have the capacity to generate and provide relevant information. 

Thus far, by information, scholars generally mean technical and legal information (see Susan has recent Annual Review of this scholarship)

- I ask about the role of a different kind of information--what we might call political information, building on Nelson and Yackee's finding that coalition size matters.

## An information-based theory of how interest groups and public attention/pressure may affect legislator behavior

|                           | Legislator Supports Rule        | Legislator Opposes Rule         |   |   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---|---|
| Constituents Support Rule | "Beacon" for credit claiming    | "Warning sign" against engaging |   |   |
| Constituents Oppose Rule  | "Warning sign" against engaging | "Fire alarm" for oversight      |   |   |
|                           |                                 |                                 |   |   |

## Why legislator attention may affect bureaucratic policymaking

- "Political cover" for agency
- Signal of the general level of public support
- Signal of potential rewards and sanctions (budgets, hearings)
- Procedural politicking (APA, hearings)

```

---

## Summary of Findings

- Congressional attention tracks overall public attention (which is driven by pressure campaigns)

- Pressure campaigns are more of a "fire alarm" or "beacon" than a "warning sign." They attract support but don't deter opposition.

-  Unlike groups and individuals, legislators most often engage when they oppose rules (supporting Lowande & Potter 2021)

- While this often puts legislators on the same side as corporations, controlling for policy position, legislators are slightly more likely to support public interest coalitions

- Lobbying efforts with more allies in Congress are more likely to win

## Procceedural politicking

> "That's why I am particularly disappointed that CEQ denied my---and more than 160 Members of the House and Senate---request for an extension of the comment period. Further, CEQ simply chose to not respond to our request for additional public hearings. CEQ has proposed a massive overhaul to a set of keystone environmental regulations that have stood in place — largely unchanged for almost half a century. By providing a mere 60-day comment period, and only two public hearings (in Colorado and Washington, DC), CEQ appears uninterested in obtaining broadscale public input." - [Oregon Representative Peter DeFazio, Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CEQ-2019-0003-169768)

Indiana Senator Richard Lugar submits a letter on behalf of a constituent. I noticed that in the from-line, it has Ocean Conservancy, and the email saves the animals. https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-R9-ES-2008-0093-8940

Three comments submitted by Senators on the CEQ opposing the rule were similar yet different. The first comment had four signatures and the second had eight signatures, and the third had 6. Some of the Senators that signed were on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Thomas R. Carper is the Chairman. His signature has been on all 3. https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CEQ-2019-0003-173057 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CEQ-2019-0003-173055
